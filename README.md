# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### `npm install`
with this command, we can install all the dependencies used in the loan management application. You can find all the packages used in package.json file

### `npm start`
This command starts our webapp and runs it on port 3000 by default. If you want to make changes, head to package.json and under scripts ->give 'start:SET PORT=`${your port number}`

### `About the application`
1. I have used React.js to implement the front end of the system
2. The backend consists of decision engine, accounting software that are already implemented
3. I have provided Xero, MYOB as accounting providers in dropdown in the UI
4. Made use of a dummy JSON data ('accounts') as api response of a single user in every case
5. Created dummy json as api is not given
6. sumAssetValue is the average of the asset values
7. profitCount is the count of profits > 0 in last twelve months
8. preAssessment is set as specified in the exercise, 20 by default
9. users can easily navigate within the web application from one page to another
10. Front end is kept minimalistic yet efficient
